	abstract = {The accuracy of numerical simulation algorithms is one of main concerns in modern Computational Fluid Dynamics. Development of new and more accurate mathe-matical models requires an insight into the problem of numerical errors. In order to construct an estimate of the solution error in Finite Volume cal-culations, it is ¯rst necessary to examine its sources. Discretisation errors can be divided into two groups: errors caused by the discretisation of the solution domain and equation discretisation errors. The ¯rst group includes insu±cient mesh reso-lution, mesh skewness and non-orthogonality. In the case of the second order Finite Volume method, equation discretisation errors are represented through numerical di®usion. Numerical di®usion coe±cients from the discretisation of the convection term and the temporal derivative are derived. In an attempt to reduce numeri-cal di®usion from the convection term, a new stabilised and bounded second-order di®erencing scheme is proposed. Three new methods of error estimation are presented.

What has been missing is a robust polyhedral meshing algorithm that can handle broad classes of domains exhibiting arbitrarily curved boundaries and sharp features. In addition, the power of primal-dual mesh pairs, exemplified by Voronoi-Delaunay meshes, has been recognized as an important ingredient in numerous formulations. The VoroCrust algorithm is the first provably correct algorithm for conforming polyhedral Voronoi meshing for non-convex and non-manifold domains with guarantees on the quality of both surface and volume elements. A robust refinement process estimates a suitable sizing field that enables the careful placement of Voronoi seeds across the surface, circumventing the need for clipping and avoiding its many drawbacks. The algorithm has the flexibility of filling the interior by either structured or random samples while preserving all sharp features in the output mesh. We demonstrate the capabilities of the algorithm on a variety of models and compare against state-of-the-art polyhedral meshing methods based on clipped Voronoi cells establishing the clear advantage of VoroCrust output.},

	abstract = {Flow simulation in a reservoir can be highly impacted by upscaling errors. These errors can be reduced by using simulation grids with cells as homogeneous as possible, hence conformable to horizons and faults. In this paper, the coordinates of 3D Voronoi seeds are optimized so that Voronoi cell facets honor the structural features. These features are modeled by piecewise linear complex (PLC). The optimization minimizes a function made of two parts: (1) a barycentric function, which ensures that the cells will be of good quality by maximizing their compactness; and (2) a conformity function, which allows to minimize the volume of cells that is isolated from the Voronoi seed w.r.t., a structural feature. To determine the isolated volume, a local approximation of the structural feature inside the Voronoi cells is used to cut the cells. It improves the algorithm efficiency and robustness compared to an exact cutting procedure. This method, used jointly with an adaptive gradient solver to minimize the function, allows dealing with complex 3D geological cases. It always produces a Voronoi simulation grid with the desired number of cells.},

              Development of models and dedicated numerical methods for dynamics in fractured rocks is an active research field, with research moving towards increasingly advanced process couplings and complex fracture networks. The inclusion of coupled processes in simulation models is challenged by the high aspect ratio of the fractures, the complex geometry of fracture networks, and the crucial impact of processes that completely change characteristics on the fracture-rock interface. This paper provides a general discussion of design principles for introducing fractures in simulators, and defines a framework for integrated modeling, discretization, and computer implementation. The framework is implemented in the open-source simulation software PorePy, which can serve as a flexible prototyping tool for multiphysics problems in fractured rocks. Based on a representation of the fractures and their intersections as lower-dimensional objects, we discuss data structures for mixed-dimensional grids, formulation of multiphysics problems, and discretizations that utilize existing software. We further present a
              Python
              implementation of these concepts in the PorePy open-source software tool, which is aimed at coupled simulation of flow and transport in three-dimensional fractured reservoirs as well as deformation of fractures and the reservoir in general. We present validation by benchmarks for flow, poroelasticity, and fracture deformation in porous media. The flexibility of the framework is then illustrated by simulations of non-linearly coupled flow and transport and of injection-driven deformation of fractures. All results can be reproduced by openly available simulation scripts.},
